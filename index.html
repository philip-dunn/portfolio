			<p>Hi, my name is Philip. After having previously obtained two degrees in different fields, Recreational Studies and Business, I decided to teach myself web development. I have always been fascinated with websites from an early age, ever since I took an introduction to computer science course back in high school. In pursuing this interest, which has now become a passion, I realized that I was good at it. Through teaching myself, I have gained knowledge and great satisfaction in problem solving and seeing the end results. What I enjoy most about web development is that this field is constantly changing and there are always new things to be learned.</p>

			<p>I specialize in building websites from scratch and doing search engine optimization (SEO). I am also familiar with building sites with Wordpress or Wix. I am always ready to take on new challenges. If you would like me to work for you on a project, you can contact me below.

				Hope to hear from you soon!</p>
